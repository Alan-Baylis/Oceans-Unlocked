# Changelog #

###	1.9.2 ###

+ BitStream: serialize bools, ints and floats with bit precision. Good for critical network data compressing.
* Some editor scripts were outside the Editor folder causing build compilation issues.


###	1.9.1 ###

+ Option: option (maybe) monad that represents the possibility of no value (better than passing null around)
+ Sort Components: right from the component context menu, you can sort your components again!
+ You can now open a scriptable object inspector by double clicking it
+ FolderPathAttribute: easily set a folder path in a script
* Fixed the script creator template error on Unity 5.6
* Some general code cleanup


### 1.9 ###

+ RequireInterfaceAttribute: use it on a UnityEngine.Object reference to restricting its assignment
+ ShowImplementedInterfacesAttribute: show in inspector all the interfaces a component implements
+ TweenFov: tween the field of view of Camera components
+ "Tween" folder and tween examples
+ RectExtensions.Center: given a Rect, it returns a center anchored copy with a width of "width"
* TweenShader: super overhaul. Now you can even test the tween from the editor (no play required).
* TweenPath: adding methods to play through the end and also backward


### 1.8 ###

+ HashSetExtensions: similar to DictionaryExtensions but for HashSet
+ TransformEditor: similar to the stock editor but with individual reset buttons next to each property
+ Collision/TriggerListener: enables you to control exactly what scripts receive Collision/Trigger events and from which colliders
+ ComponentReference: saves a reference to a component that can be easily retrieved where ComponentReference is located
* Timer: now works normally even if you call "OnUpdate()" more than once on Update
* AnimatorProperties: they now can be used even if there's no sibling Animator component
- ParticleSystemHelper: its functionality was not compliant with Unity's new way of handling ParticleSystems
- "Sort Components", "Move to Top", "Move to Bottom": this feature was a "hack". Since 5.5, it's broken because of some Unity internal refactorings.


### 1.7 ###

+ TweenPath: Interpolates a transform through a Bezier or linear path of control points
+ Fix small bug on Modifiable
+ Some other fixes and code improvements
> Shoutout to Johannes

### 1.5 ###

+ BitStrap.Examples namespace: all examples are now inside of this namespace.

### 1.4 ###

+ PropertyDrawerHelper: Methods that help to code a PropertyDrawer editor.
+ ParticleSystemExtensions: Extensions to the UnityEngine.ParticleSystem class.
* Timer: Added Progress property. 0.0 when the timer just started to 1.0 when the timer finished and stopped.
* TimerDrawer: Enhanced the editor.
* RectExtensions: Left() and Right() behaviours were swapped when "width" was negative. This is more intuitive.

+ ModifiableInt and ModifiableFloat: a specialized and serializable version of Modifiable<T>;
