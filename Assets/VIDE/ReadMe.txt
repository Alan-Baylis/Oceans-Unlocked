RESOURCES:

The dialogues you create with the VIDE Editor will be stored inside the Dialogues folder inside Resources. 
These files contain all of the data required for your interface to work. 
You may duplicate and rename them, but it is not recommended as it can cause discrepancies. 

It is adviced to keep back-ups of these files in a different folder outside the project. 

The dialogue files are interchangeable between projects, just make sure that they are inside the VIDE/Resources/Dialogues folder! 

---

VIDE_Data: Script that will handle in-game dialogue data. Scene component optional.
VIDE_Assign: Component attached to every game object that will have a dialogue. Optional.

EXAMPLES:

You'll find 2 example scenes that you can study and play around with.

DATA:

Do not use/edit any of the files within these folders.
